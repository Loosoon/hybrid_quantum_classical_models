# hybrid_quantum_classical_models
Python implementation of hybrid quantum classical models, HQResNet and HQCNN.


# Before starting
Install all the required Python libraries.

pip install matplotlib

pip install torch

pip install torchvision

pip install qiskit

pip install qiskit_machine_learning

Note: matplotlib is for plotting all figures, and torch is for building classical neural networks and conneting them together with quantum parts,
while qiskit and qiskit_machine_learning are for creating quantum neural networks as well as working as the quantum environment simulator.
